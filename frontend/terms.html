        <p>I offer support for my plugins on the <a href="https://discord.gg/tVYhJfyDWG" class="link">HuskHelp Discord
            server</a>. We try and respond to enquiries as quickly as possible there. Once you have joined the Discord,
            you can use the button in the <code>#create-ticket</code> channel to open a ticket and explain your issue
            and a member of staff will get back to you.</p>
        <p>If you purchase a premium resource, such as HuskTowns and HuskSync, you will be asked to provide
            proof of purchase.
            Once proof has been provided, you will be assigned a customer role to confirm your verification. Should you
            leave the HuskSync discord you will need to re-verify.</p>
        <p><i class="fa-solid fa-ban"></i>&nbsp;Please note that we are unable to provide support with the
            following topics for various reasons. We apologise for the inconvenience.</p>
        <ul class="two-column-list">
            <li>Installing DynMap, BlueMap, SquareMap, or setting up a reverse proxy.</li>
            <li>Installing Redis. Some of my plugins make use of it, and although we are happy to provide
                recommendations we do not offer system administration services.</li>
            <li>Installing or upgrading MySQL.</li>
            <li>Installing Pterodactyl&#xFF0D;or other system administration tasks.</li>
            <li>Integration with <a href="https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/cmi.3742/" target="_blank">CMI</a> (Content
                Management Interface). CMI is a complex plugin that tends to not work well with other resources.
                Unfortunately, we will have to decline support requests or suggestions that involve implementing or
                fixing issues with CMI.
            </li>
            <li>Support for HuskHomes v1.x&#xFF0D;Please update to the latest version of HuskHomes (v2.x).</li>
            <li>Support for fixing issues caused by running a cracked (offline mode) server. If you're getting "Subquery
                returned more than one row" errors, see <a
                        href="docs/huskhomes/Setup#sql-error-subquery-returns-multiple-rows" target="_blank">here</a>.
            </li>
            <li>Support for fixing issues caused by changes made by forks. My plugins support Spigot, Paper, BungeeCord,
                Waterfall or Velocity. Proxy forks like Flamecord in particular are known to cause problems.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Please note that all staff members are volunteers and we reserve the right to remove or ban users from the
            HuskHelp discord who behave inappropriately.</p>
