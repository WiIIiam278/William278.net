Loaded Dice by William278</a></iframe>

_"Play as a bloke who lives inside a die."_

A simple puzzle-platformer game, with a few neat mechanics. Did I mention you play as a dice-person-dude-thing?

There's only a single level (though with more time, we definitely had more ideas!)

Made for the GMTK 2022 Game Jam with the theme of "Roll the Dice".

## Controls

* **Arrow keys / WASD** - Move character left/right
* **SPACE / Up arrow** - Jump
* **Number keys 1 / 2 / 3 / 4** - "Roll" (choose) die ability.
    * You can also press R to cycle through them
